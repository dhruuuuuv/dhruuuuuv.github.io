        <h1 class="title">tired</h1>

        <div class="contents">
            i look upon the world <br>
            and it's slightly faded <br>
            slightly askew <br>
            like viewed through frosted glass. <br>
                <br>
            it's a false perception <br>
            whatever a false perception means, <br>
            but it's not real: <br>
            i therefore nothing is. <br>
                <br>
            i sip on coffee and water. <br>
            the world regains slight clarity. <br>
            but you're still slightly shifted out of sync <br>
            with me. <br>
                <br>
            because according to me and the way i write <br>
            i am all that exists. <br>
            no-one else. <br>
            i am the beginning and the end. <br>
                <br>
            and also the middle, <br>
            those tiny bits that others look upon <br>
            with a scorn on their face. <br>
            but i think it's all real. <br>
                <br>
            the world is not here. <br>
            in honesty it doesn't matter if i am <br>
            final, or not. <br>
            because it ticks and tocks <br>
                <br>
            and i pass by. <br>
            just watching <br>
            just waiting <br>
            for the world to kick in. <br>
                <br>
            so i yearn for the moments when reality doesn't seem faded. <br>
            when the sun pours on me and <br>
            i am happy. <br>
            and i am no longer tired. <br>
