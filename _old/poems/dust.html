        <h1 class="title">sparkling dust while listening to tycho</h1>

        <div class="contents">
            sparkling dust <br>
            you roam freely, sweetly <br>
            lost into the world <br>
            until you're beaten by sunlight <br>

 <br>            the beams give you life <br>
            smash you into existence <br>
            you bleed hope <br>
            you exist <br>

 <br>            whilst lost, terribly unsure <br>
            if the world continues or ceases while <br>
            you are hidden <br>
            does it matter ? <br>

 <br>            the bolder of you believe that <br>
            all revolves around you <br>
            while you are not there <br>
            you are all that revolves <br>

 <br>            and yet, that chaotic moment <br>
            where the cruel iridescence <br>
            observes you into existence <br>
            is beautiful <br>

 <br>            you are brought fresh <br>
            clean, pure, into a world that you <br>
            know nothing of <br>
            and therefore collect hope <br>

 <br>            you drift <br>
            assuredly <br>
            lazily <br>
            enjoying the excitement of pure existence <br>

 <br>            knowing so little of the sweet pain <br>
            of existence <br>
            but that does not matter <br>
            you capture colour and swirl it <br>

 <br>            it explodes all around you <br>
            you keep the ones you need <br>
            and once full <br>
            hurl back the rest <br>

 <br>            beings undermine you <br>
            as being small and insignificance <br>
            but mere existence <br>
            gives you more significance <br>

 <br>            more than your former siblings <br>
            could ever lazily dream of <br>
            vibrating silently <br>
