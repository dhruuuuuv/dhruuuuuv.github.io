            and as the light gleams through the window <br>
            you lose force colliding symmetrically with the glass <br>
            you spew prism, mass collection <br>
            tearing beauty upon the world <br>
                <br> <br>
            who knew that you could compose so much <br>
            your poker hair, your twisted face <br>
            your expression vocalises harmoniously <br>
            what your face once forgot <br>
                <br> <br>
            a distorted set of component beams <br>
            constructs the view once known as me <br>
            i lose depth, i lose faith <br>
            but a self is strengthened <br>
                <br> <br>
            the keys go klicker-klack <br>
            bitterly reflecting away <br>
            i look into your sunken tomes <br>
            while the days sway <br>
                <br> <br>
            i look into the glassen eyes <br>
            we pretend that consciousness is passed <br>
            through mutual ignorance of bitter lakes <br>
            distorted truths flow through <br>
                <br> <br>
            sunken surfaces, rolling views <br>
            your tepid glass lets through <br>
            lacking the solidity of a swampy lake <br>
            but holding strong resistance to a shoe <br>
                <br> <br>
            we look and see and look and be <br>
            i draw resolute you draw frustration <br>
            we are what we are and we be what we be <br>
            though we both are as hollow as each other. <br>
