        <h1 class="title">my brain tricks me into talking to it</h1>

        <div class="contents"> <br>
            you're not there <br>
            well you are <br>
            just not you <br>
            you're just atoms and atoms <br>
                <br>
             but more importantly <br>
            patterns and patterns <br>
            feeding themselves <br>
            until I arise <br>
                <br>
             and then the tricking begins <br>
            you lure me in a technicolour display <br>
            alluring delights and diffused atoms <br>
            atoms feeding atoms <br>
                <br>
             then you developed a voice <br>
            we developed in tandem <br>
            but that just wasn't ever <br>
            quite enough <br>
                <br>
             you needed more attention <br>
            and more <br>
            until I had to nourish you with myself <br>
            and you got greedy <br>
                <br>
            as all do <br>
            more and more you sucked me away from <br>
            reality <br>
            because the dreamshow is tempting <br>
                <br>
            both simultaneously a stone radiating <br>
            through crisp water <br>
            and stillness itself <br>
            echoed through chords <br>
                <br>
             you are delicious <br>
            delightful no doubt <br>
            a million metronomes eloquently in sync <br>
            a casual gradient <br>
                <br>
             it still wasn't enough <br>
            you needed my life <br>
            you needed me <br>
            so you drew me away <br>
                <br>
             sold me false interpretations of reality <br>
            to selfishly feed yourself <br>
            until I was no more <br>
            a transclucent echo <br>
                <br>
             left with falsehoods <br>
            and echoes of echoes <br>
            and internal loudness <br>
            and external softness <br>
                <br>
             and you liked it <br>
            so you'll keep me talking to you <br>
            to feed yourself <br>
            else you'd be lost <br>
