            so <br>
            i'll stare at you <br>
            in your bitter eyes <br>
            and you'll throw me back into nothingness <br>

 <br>            i use you <br>
            and you use me <br>
            you crystallise the waves <br>
            but there is nothing but emptiness <br>

 <br>            a million different voices shouting <br>
            at me all at once <br>
            compressed into a single set of sines <br>
            but there's no contentedness <br>

 <br>            you give me an option <br>
            to be less delirious <br>
            less serious <br>
            but you leave me with bitterness <br>

 <br>            that i couldn't be a better person <br>
            that i need you <br>
            and i need to live in this hollow shell <br>
            of existence, and smokiness <br>

 <br>            we act like there's no-one else <br>
            we're all merely everyone <br>
            shifted back and forth <br>
            but i'll forgive your sinfulness <br>

 <br>            so i'll stare at you <br>
            run from you <br>
            give in to you <br>
            and you'll throw me back into nothingness <br>
