        <h1 class="title">they called me</h1>

        <div class="contents">
            harmless words <br>
            docile things really <br>
            but still <br>
            they exist <br>

 <br>            minds chattering away <br>
            while you and they <br>
            quietly develop <br>
            in the background <br>

 <br>            they look on you like you're human  <br>
            but you're not <br>
            they're not <br>
            they're more <br>

 <br>            they're an entity <br>
            greater than life and greater than <br>
            soul <br>
            but the devil resides within <br>

 <br>            you chuckle <br>
            dismissing whatever uncomfort niggles at you <br>
            because the darkness propagates itself <br>
            you smirk <br>

 <br>            applaude yourself for your <br>
            hilarity <br>
            aptitude <br>
            humour <br>

 <br>            not a single thought deep <br>
            and I just sit and watch <br>
            angrily at times <br>
            but watch <br>

 <br>            and watch and watch <br>
            watch me watching <br>
            and then you say <br>
            why watching? <br>

 <br>            and smirk to yourself <br>
            applaude <br>
            I have it easy as a watcher <br>
            I don't have to think like you <br>
