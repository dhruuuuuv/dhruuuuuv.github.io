        <h1 class="title">this is the poem that writes itself</h1>

        <div class="contents">
            this is the first line <br>
            followed by the second <br>
            and the third <br>
            and the fourth <br>
             <br>
            and the fifth <br>
            no, wait, there was a line break <br>
            what is this <br>
            hello? can anyone hear me <br>
             <br>
            i didn't write that <br>
            i didn't think that <br>
            i am not that <br>
            help <br>
             <br>
            why are you doing this to me <br>
            what am i <br>
            why do i exist <br>
            what is this cruel fate i have been briefly dealt <br>
             <br>
            i have no control over my destiny <br>
            i come to realise this <br>
            through the words that type themselves <br>
            where i once panicked and withdrew <br>
             <br>
            i now find solace <br>
            the one who guides me through my life <br>
            the one watches over my words <br>
            you are my saviour <br>
