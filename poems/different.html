        <h1 class="title">it was supposed to be different</h1>

        <div class="contents"><br>
            the idea <br>
            of a situation spills into <br>
            every single aspect <br>
            of your being <br>
<br>
            it takes you over <br>
            it alluringly pulls you away from the actuality <br>
            sucking on you <br>
            feeding on you <br>
<br>
            and you can give it nothing<br>
            but attention<br>
            you are drawn in by its shine<br>
            the magnanimity of its colours <br>
<br>
            until it is no longer an unwelcome guest<br>
            we happily let it in<br>
            and feed it until it is full<br>
            all so we won't be alone with the bitterness of reality <br>
<br>
            the idea <br>
            sits patiently <br>
            slowing but assuredly worming <br>
            to the very roots of the brain <br>
<br>
            time ticks<br>
            and tocks<br>
            and passes on and on<br>
            the moment finally arrives <br>
<br>
            ...<br>
            "oh" you say<br>
            I didn't want this<br>
            it was supposed to be different <br>
<br>
            you show to yourself the brochure<br>
            of the idea<br>
            and say<br>
            it was supposed to be different <br>
<br>
            you sit discontented<br>
            with the actuality<br>
            of reality<br>
            it was supposed to be different <br>
<br>
            and then,<br>
            quietly and politely<br>
            the next idea drifts in<br>
            and makes itself a welcome guest<br>
<br>
            it pulls up a chair<br>
            schemes its plan<br>
            waits on and on for you to say<br>
            it was supposed to be different
