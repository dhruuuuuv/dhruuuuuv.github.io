        <h1 class="title">the poem exists so long as I keep on writing</h1>

        <div class="contents">
            it gives me such a sense of strength <br>
            of superiority <br>
            to bring a being into creation <br>
            I pull thee from the depths of a dictionary <br>
             <br>
            you becometh truth for a little while <br>
            you exist <br>
            I have made you and you look upon the world <br>
            with fresh, untarnished eyes <br>
             <br>
            with a view I wish I still held <br>
            lost with years of experience <br>
            and suffering <br>
            and living <br>
             <br>
            should a man have such strength? <br>
            it twists and distorts his self <br>
            power does that to a man <br>
            no-one should hold this power that I do <br>
             <br>
            you sit there silently <br>
            just hoping that I won't stop <br>
            the moment I lift my finger <br>
            you drift into nothingness <br>
             <br>
            back onto the spaceless beingless timeless <br>
            universe you once called home <br>
            it is, in a way, crueler to have brought you into existence <br>
            you have tasted the divine delights of being <br>
             <br>
            and yearn for more. <br>
            we are not so different, you & i <br>
            we both know that our time is finite <br>
            and that what matters is not the time's length  <br>
             <br>
            but rather what we do with that time <br>
            and how we come about accepting our limited lifespan <br>
            do we run screaming from the inferno nothingness <br>
            or accept it as we do an old friend <br>
             <br>
            I truly am sorry that you are condemned to end <br>
            that I will be your end <br>
            but know that while I graced you into being I had nothing but innocent intentions, and pure spirit <br>
             <br>
            our time together was short <br>
            but I hope that the glimpse of greatness gave you hope <br>
            gave you a sense of the beauty of existence <br>
            good bye <br>
