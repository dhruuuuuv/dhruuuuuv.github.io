        <h1 class="title">i can feel my neurons shifting</h1>

        <div class="contents">
            when i stop and think <br>
            and think <br>
            and think some more <br>
            i feel like i can feel my neurons shifiting <br>
            <br>
            my brain feels like a mess <br>
            but i feel the structure <br>
            the specific pattern that makes me, me <br>
            resonate, and i feel <br>
            <br>
            content. <br>
            and generally feel <br>
            sad and happy and lost, <br>
            but most importantly <br>
            <br>
            i can feel myself <br>
            i can feel my structure <br>
            i can write these words and <br>
            i can feel my neurons shifting <br>
            <br>
            a new skill draws upon me <br>
            and the cognitive structure slightly changes <br>
            neuroplasticity <br>
            and i am lost to the oblivion <br>
            <br>
            of the old world. <br>
            and the brain that once saw <br>
            the world is birthed anew. <br>
            an entirely shifted perspective. <br>
            <br>
            i think you're important, but you're not <br>
            really, all you are is neurons configured <br>
            in a certain way <br>
            making 'me' me. <br>
            <br>
            everything i thought i had, <br>
            are neurons <br>
            are molecules <br>
            are atoms. <br>
            <br>
            so i look upon the world <br>
            and as i stare <br>
            slightly sombre. <br>
            i can feel my neurons shifting. <br>
