        <h1 class="title">door within a door</h1>

        <div class="contents">
            one fall, sunken within the trees<br>
            a boy traverses a clearing<br>
            within the sinuous depth of green<br>
            he finds a space worth hearing<br>
                <br>
            in the center of the space<br>
            lies a door within a door<br>
            his brain pieces together with haste<br>
            constructing an image to be sure<br>
                <br>
            the first handle gleamed beckoningly<br>
            shining beyond skies<br>
            the next handle seemed secondly<br>
            rising beyond deep heights<br>
                <br>
            the boy started deep into the depth of the jar<br>
            dreaming of the potentials beyond<br>
            a solace from the bitter world<br>
            a world without prior sound<br>
                <br>
            the sounds of the jungle haunted him<br>
            his symphony was silence<br>
            the door seemed to promise<br>
            solace to his once lost assignments<br>
                <br>
            with a quivering hand and a hand in his quiver<br>
            he trembled towards the door<br>
            shakily a hand stretched forward<br>
            eyes fixed cynically to the floor<br>
                <br>
            the first door swung<br>
            the second door swung<br>
            the door revealed upon itself<br>
            the purest nature of things<br>
                <br>
            a door cannot exist within a door<br>
            and yet the scene stretched forth<br>
            adored doors and a door adored<br>
            a view the devil was unsure<br>
                <br>
            static hills and rolling troughs<br>
            nested the truth within<br>
            the eyes of the once innocent boy<br>
            corrupted without sin<br>
                <br>
            the sheer weight of logic,<br>
            collapsed upon his head<br>
            groggily he fought home<br>
            and collapsed straight into bed<br>
                <br>
            days roamed freely while the boy searched<br>
            a door within a door<br>
            adored and adored<br>
            and yet he was never sure<br>
